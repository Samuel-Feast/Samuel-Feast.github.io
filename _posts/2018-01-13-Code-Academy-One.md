  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson I was quite enthusiastic as I have always quite wanted to learn Python, but had never previously had the opportunity. The Code Academy website was very effective in having me understand the code and being able to replicate and understand it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes when another student asked me for a pointer I ended up giving them all the code as a matter of time saving. In the future I want to be able to explain the code without giving the whole answer away.</td>

    <td>Next time I will only focus on my work and will only help others when they are completely stuck on the task.</td>
