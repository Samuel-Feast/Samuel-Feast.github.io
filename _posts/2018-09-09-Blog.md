    <td>I struggled a little bit this lesson due to us not having our regular teacher. Although the cover teacher was helpful, he didn't have the level of knowledge that out normal teacher had. I managed to complete the task, but I would have wanted to do more in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>= - Equals Sign - This was the tell the program that the following code was a command.
Vlookup - Vertical Lookup - This was to tell the program to look for a cell above it.
F30 - Cell F30 - This is the cell of the letter I want to encrypt.
$A:$B - Column A and B - This is to select column A and column B, A being the alphabet and B being the cipher.

I completed the decoding process by adding another alphabet in C. This would shift the letters back reversing the process I did in the previous week.
