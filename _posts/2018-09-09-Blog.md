  <tr>
    <td>= - Equals Sign - This was the tell the program that the following code was a command.
Vlookup - Vertical Lookup - This was to tell the program to look for a cell above it.
F31 - Cell F31 - This is the cell of the letter I want to encrypt.
$A:$B - Column A and B - This is to select column A and column B, A being the alphabet and B being the cipher.

CONCATENATE - Combines the contents of multiple cells all into one so it is easier to read and copy and paste.
F31:P31 - Takes all the characters within this cell boundary and concatenates them.
