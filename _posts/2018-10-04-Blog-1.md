    <td>When I was first tasked with making a shift cipher using google sheets, I opted to have a quick look on google to try and get a rough gauge on how the code may go. As it happened the code I found online was very dissimilar to what we used in class, but it did prepare me to know roughly what I would hear when the task was explained.

Repost. Sorry for bad order.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>= - Equals Sign - This was the tell the program that the following code was a command.
Vlookup - Vertical Lookup - This was to tell the program to look for a cell above it.
F30 - Cell F30 - This is the cell of the letter I want to encrypt.
$A:$B - Column A and B - This is to select column A and column B, A being the alphabet and B being the cipher.
