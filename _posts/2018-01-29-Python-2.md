    <td>I focused hard on remembering code that we learnt in previous lessons to propel forward my knowledge. Without this I would have found it quite difficult to advance myself without basic knowledge.</td>

    <td>I never read the worksheet from the previous lesson which would have helped massively as it would have jogged my mind and helped me remember some of the more basic parts of python.</td>
