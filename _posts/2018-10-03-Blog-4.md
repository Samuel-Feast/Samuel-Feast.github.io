    <td>Before this lesson began I had got my cipher to encode and decode a specific amount, but my next task was to get the cipher working at any shift by changing just one value. This required to make a data sheet that was quite time consuming. By the end of the lesson I had got the cipher to encode itself automatically with any value from 1-26, yet, in doing this I inadvertently broke my decoding cipher which I will have to fix in a further lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>= - Equals Sign - This was the tell the program that the following code was a command.
IFERROR - This makes it so there is no error displayed when there is no value in the cell.
Vlookup - Vertical Lookup - This was to tell the program to look for a cell above it.
Sheet2! - This is referring to the data sheet I created.

CONCATENATE - Combines the contents of multiple cells all into one so it is easier to read and copy and paste.
F31:P31 - Takes all the characters within this cell boundary and concatenates them.
