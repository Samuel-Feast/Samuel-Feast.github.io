  <tr>
    <td>= - Equals Sign - This was the tell the program that the following code was a command.
IFERROR - This makes it so there is no error displayed when there is no value in the cell.
Vlookup - Vertical Lookup - This was to tell the program to look for a cell above it.
Sheet2! - This is referring to the data sheet I created.
$G18 - This is the cell where the number I want to shift my text by.
CONCATENATE - Combines the contents of multiple cells all into one so it is easier to read and copy and paste.
F31:P31 - Takes all the characters within this cell boundary and concatenates them. 
Len - Length of specific cell.
